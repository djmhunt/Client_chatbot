## Customizing Content

### Adding New Clients

1. **Create a new JSON file** in the `personalities/` directory:
```json
{
  "name": "ClientName",
  "condition": "Mental Health Condition",
  "age": 25,
  "background": "Brief background description",
  "personality": "Detailed personality prompt for AI..."
}
```

2. **Restart the application** - new clients will automatically appear in the selector

### Customizing Initial Messages

1. **Edit `start_messages.txt`** - add one message per line
2. **Messages are randomly selected** when clients begin sessions
3. **No code changes needed** - updates take effect immediately

### Modifying Client Presentations

1. **Edit JSON files** in the `personalities/` directory
2. **Update the `personality` field** to modify AI behavior
3. **Adjust `background` and `condition`** for different scenarios

#### Option B: Azure Container Instances (Advanced)

1. **Build Docker image** (Dockerfile included)
2. **Push to Azure Container Registry**
3. **Deploy to Container Instances**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python dependencies not found:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Port already in use:**
   - Flask automatically finds an available port
   - Check for other running applications on port 8000

3. **API key errors:**
   - Verify your Claude API key format (starts with `sk-ant-`)
   - Check API key permissions in [Anthropic console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits

4. **Client personalities not loading:**
   - Check that all JSON files in `personalities/` directory are valid
   - Verify file permissions for the personalities directory

5. **Start messages not working:**
   - Ensure `start_messages.txt` exists and has content
   - Check that file contains one message per line

### Development Issues

1. **Flask import errors:**
   ```bash
   conda activate your-environment
   pip install flask anthropic
   ```

2. **JSON parsing errors:**
   - Validate JSON files using an online JSON validator
   - Check for trailing commas or syntax errors

3. **File not found errors:**
   - Ensure all files are in the correct directory structure
   - Check file paths are relative to the app.py location

### Azure Deployment Issues

- **Logs:** Check in Azure Portal ‚Üí App Service ‚Üí Log stream
- **Configuration:** All config is in the application files
- **Dependencies:** Ensure `requirements.txt` is up to date
- **Python Version:** Verify `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11
